personal-website
================

This is the source code of my personal website. Currently it's a Maven project but this will change as Maven it's not needed anymore.

It was scaffolded with Yeoman (using the webapp generator, 0.4.9). It represented a way for me to move the first steps with Yeoman, Bootstrap, Grunt, Bower and other tools.
